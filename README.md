# WeatherApp-Android
‚õà Weather app with OpenWeatherMap API.  Here i demonstrate the use of Modern Android development tools - (Kotlin, Architecture Components, MVVM, LiveData, Material Components)

## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io) - Dependency Injection Framework
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back.
- [GSON Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/gson) - A Converter which uses Gson for serialization to and from JSON.
- [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) -  For implementing interceptor, logging and mocking web server.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.


## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.
